Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer.

If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer.

If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu.

You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls.

You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides.

To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\nBefore you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nImportant:\nFlex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the\nFlex Map v1 User Guide\n.\nThis guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics:\nApp navigation\nPin Layers\nMap Layers\nFavorites\nSaved Maps\nHeatmaps\nMap Settings\nData Settings\nUser permissions and features\nInteracting with the map\nDemo notes\nApp Navigation\nMap controls display on the right side of the screen.\nThe table below describes each of the map controls.\nIcon\nTool Description\nZoom in\n/\nout \u2014\nAllows you to adjust the zoom level for the map.\nReset bearing to north \u2014\nResets the map's orientation\u00a0to display north at the top.\nUndo\n/\nRedo \u2014\nUnmakes or remakes a change to the map.\nExport \u2014\nEnables you to export your map as an image, PowerPoint file, or PDF.\nReturn to default \u2014\nReturns the map to its default settings.\nClear Map \u2014\nClears the map of all layers.\nSave Map \u2014\nSaves the current map configuration.\nAt the top of the screen are the main menu and the search bar.\nYou can access most of the app's features from the main menu, by opening the hamburger menu. Each feature is described later in this guide.\nAfter you open the main menu, you can\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nAfter you open any feature,\u00a0you can\nExpand\nor\nCollapse\nthe feature interface or\nClose\nit to return to the default screen.\nUse the search bar to find locations from your connected data and display them temporarily on the map so you can favorite them. Learn more about\nFavorites\nbelow.\nPin Layers\nIn the main menu, select\nPin Layers\nto open the search interface.\nHere, you can create Layers, a subset of the locations data connected to the app.\nThe following table describes the tools in the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nIcon\nTool Description\nGroup \u2014\nCreates a new group.\nItem \u2014\nCreates a new item.\nClone \u2014\nCopies the currently selected Pin Layer. The copied layer displays at the bottom of the Pin Layer list, with the name formatted as\nName of\nPin Layer\n- copy.\nList \u2014\nShows the list of individual locations that are currently being displayed.\nCreating a Pin Layer\nSelect\nItem\nto create a new Pin Layer.\nThe\nNew Pin Layers\nSearch\ninterface displays.\nSelect the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nBelow the selected column, select whether to include locations that are\nIn\nor\nNot In\nthe values you select from the column.\n(Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select\nItem\nagain to add another Pin Layer to the current layers.\nFirst, select whether the Pin Layer has an\nAnd\nor an\nOr\nfilter.\nAn\nAnd\nfilter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all\nAnd\ncriteria display.\nUsing an\nOr\nfilter adds all locations that match\u00a0that filter along with any other filters that are set.\nNext, choose the category of additional Layer:\nParent Id\n,\nLatitude\n,\nLongitude\n,\nLocation Name\n, or\nCity\n.\nTwo more options,\nChannel Type\nand\nChannel Group\n, only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.\nYou can\nDelete\nany Pin Layer to remove that filter.\nSelect\nList\nto view the results based on the search criteria.\n(Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the\nFavorites\nsection of the app.\nAfter adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the\nPin Layers\nmenu:\nSelect Icon\n,\nSelect Color\n, and\nSave\n.\nAdding Icons and Colors\nYou can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.\nChoose\nSelect Icon\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu.\nThe icon palette opens.\nSelect an icon to add to the Pin Layer.\n(Optional) Go to the\nSize\ntab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.\nYou can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.\nThe icon displays on the map. If it doesn't display, adjust the zoom level.\nIn the\nPin Layers\nmenu, choose\nSelect Color\nto choose the display color for your search.\nSelect\nSave\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu to save your search.\nThe\nSave Pin Layers Search\nmodal displays.\nEnter a\nName\nand choose a\nFolder\nor\nGroup\nto save the search in or create one.\nSelect\nSave\n.\nYou can now access your search in a list of created searches and groups under the\nGroup\nicon in the\nPin Layers\nmenu. You can also access all saved items from the\nSaved Maps\nsection of the main menu.\nGroups and Items\nIn Flex Map v2, groups are folders that hold and organize items you create.\nWhen you select\nGroup\nin the\nPin Layers\nmenu, you create a folder that displays in the groups list. You can then name and open the group and drag any items into the group. You can also nest folders by dragging a group into another group.\nAfter you save an Item or search inside a folder or group, you can interact with it.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\non a search to toggle it on or off. When a search is on, the locations of the search display on the map.\nRemove an item or group by selecting\nDelete\n.\nImportant:\nIf you delete a group, all items inside the group, including nested items, are also deleted.\nYou can edit an Item or search at any time in\nPin Layers\n.\nNote:\nApp admins see an additional option for items and groups: the\nShare\nbutton. Admins can share items and groups with other app users. Learn more about admin functionality under\nUser Permissions and Features\n.\nMap Layers\nMap Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.\nTo begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nCreating a Map Layer\nIn the main menu, select\nMap Layers\n.\nSelect\nItem\n.\nThe new Layers interface displays.\nIn the\nMap\u00a0Layers\nmenu, there are three icons on the left side:\nCircle\n,\nPolygon\n, and\nPolyline\n.\nWhen you select\nCircle\n, you can create a colored circle on the map with the area and radius provided. Adjust the size of the circle by clicking and dragging the orange dots on the perimeter of the circle. You can also click and drag the entire shape. Change the color of the circle by using the\nSelect Color\nicon. If you want to start over, select\nCircle\nagain to delete it.\nThe second of the three icons is\nPolygon\nand allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select\nPolygon\nand choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the\nSelect Color\nicon. To delete the shape, select\nPolygon\nagain.\nThe last icon is\nPolyline\n, which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you\u00a0placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select\nPolyline\nagain.\nFavorites\nFavorites\nis where you can find any locations favorited in the app, allowing you to quickly find important locations when you return to the app. You can add locations to\nFavorites\nin a few ways.\nIf you enter a term in the main search bar of the app, a list of matching locations returns. You can then select the star icon next to a location to favorite it.\nYou can also favorite currently displayed locations in the\nList\nscreen of the\nPin Layers\nsection.\nWhen viewing\nFavorites\n, you can create Groups and add favorited items to them, like you can for searches and Heatmaps. You can remove locations from\nFavorites\nby selecting\nDelete\nfor the location.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto toggle a favorited location on and off.\nAdmin users can share favorited locations here by selecting\nShare\nfor the location.\nSaved Maps\nAny user can save the current configuration of territories and searches at any time by selecting\nSave Map\nin the map controls. When you save a map, you are prompted to enter a name for it.\nYou can see all of the maps by going to\nSaved Maps\nin the main menu. Here, you can add saved maps to Groups or delete them like other items in the app.\nAdmin users can also share saved maps by selecting\nShare\non a saved map.\nHeatmaps\nYou can find\nHeatmaps\nin the main menu. Follow the steps below to create a new Heatmap.\nNote:\nHeatmaps only take effect after you save them.\nSelect\nCreate a New Heatmap\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Layer\n.\nSelect a\nHeatmap Metric\n.\nUnder\nColor Range\n, select\nEdit Range\n.\nSelect the colored rectangle to choose and apply\u00a0a color to a certain range.\nManually input the numerals for the range.\nRemove any range by selecting\nDelete\n.\nAbove the ranges, you can\nReset to default\n,\nClear all\n, and\nAdd new\n.\nMake sure to select\nApply Range\nto save your changes.\nTo activate the Heatmap, select\nSave\n.\nYou can then name your Heatmap and save it to a new or existing folder or Group.\nSelect\nView\n/\nHide\nto display the new Heatmap on the map.\nDepending on the column you choose for the Heatmap, the map legend displays different numerical ranges.\nNote:\nOnly one Heatmap can display at a time, unlike searches where many can display at one time.\nMap Settings\nMap Settings\nis the final option in the main menu.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you can determine certain map behaviors rendering options, including rendering Pin Layers in standard cluster mode or allowing all pins to render individually on the map. You also have access to new Map Layers in the\nBase Layer\nmenu.\nData Settings\nNote:\nThis section is only visible on the main menu for card owners and app admins.\nIf you are a card owner or app admin, you have total control over the data that is available to the map for locations and Heatmap metrics.\nFrom the main menu, select\nData Settings\nto view two options:\nThe\nSearch and Display Preferences\nallow you to customize what is shown on your map.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nallows you to define metrics for your Heatmap Layers and associate them with a color scale on the map.\nSearch and Display Preferences\nWhen you select\nSearch and Display Preferences\n, the settings grid displays. There are three sections in the settings:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your core Locations DataSet. The Schema settings have five editable elements:\nSearchInclude\nis the list of fields that you want to be available in the\nPin Layers\nsearch builder. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nStatic Label\nallows you to choose one field to display\u00a0directly under the Pin on the map.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nDisplayType\nlets you tell Flex Map what type of data is in the field so it can handle special exceptions like links and images.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nThe\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nsettings allow you to define and choose the metric fields you want to allow the app user to build off in the\nHeatmaps\nsection of\u00a0Flex Map v2.\nHeatmap Metric Mapping\nhas the same three sections as\nSearch and Display Preferences\n:\nSchema\n,\nDisplay Order\n, and\nTooltip Order\n.\nIn the\nSchema\nsection, you can configure what you see in and on the map from your Heatmaps DataSet. The\nSchema\nsettings\u00a0have five editable elements:\nUse as Metric\nis the list of fields that you want to use as metrics in\nHeatmaps\n. Check the boxes for the fields you want to include.\nDisplayInclude\ndisplays the chosen fields on the detail view of a selected Pin.\nTooltipInclude\nallows you to include the selected fields' value in the tooltip when you hover over a Pin on the map.\nLabel\nallows you to rename your metrics fields for better picklist selections in the builder.\nAggregation\nallows you to select the aggregation method.\nAfter you update any setting, select\nExpand\nand then\nSave & Close\nto return to the app where your updates are live.\nIn the\nDisplay Order\nsection, you can configure the order of your display fields by dragging and dropping them.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nIn the\nTooltip Order\nsection, you can also drag and drop the fields into the order that you want.\nMake sure to\nSave & Close\n.\nUser Permissions and Features\nThe app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nAdmin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,\u00a0and configure a default map and a default center. See\nMap Settings\n,\u00a0above.\nStandard users can\u00a0create, edit, and delete\u00a0their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They\u00a0can't share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can\u00a0view items that admins share with them. They can't\u00a0create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.\nTo learn more, see the\nFlex Map v2 Implementation Guide\n.\nInteracting with the Map\nAfter you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.\nSearches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.\nZoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.\nSelecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.\nSelecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.\nHovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins\u00a0can configure in the\nData Settings\n.\nMap Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.\nHovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric.\nHovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents.\nSelecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area.\nA legend of what each of the Heatmap's colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.\nEnter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.\nYou can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.\nNote:\nAdmins see options to\nSet as Default\nand\nSet as Center\nat the bottom of the app.\nSelecting\nSet as Default\nsaves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.\nSelecting\nSet as Center\nsets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then\u00a0save the revised view\u00a0so that other users view\u00a0it\u00a0when they open the app.\nDemo Notes\nOne way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.\nThen show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005048\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

When the repository is saved, the first version is committed.\n5. Select\nSave Repository\n.\nThe\nShare Access\nmodal displays. You can share the linked repository with the development instance during this step or later. For more information, see the Instance Sharing heading of\nDomo Sandbox\n.\n6. In the list of\nInstances Without Access\n,\u00a0find your development instance and change the permissions from\nNo Access\nto\nCan Promote.\nNote:\nOnly instances with pre-configured relationships display. For information on inviting instances, see the Instance Relationships heading of\nDomo Sandbox.\n7. Select\nClose.\nThe repository is stored in Sandbox in the\nMy Repositories\ntab, and access is shared with the development instance.\nCommitting the Linked Repository\nThe initial commit occurs if specified while creating the repository.\nIf no committed version exists, complete these steps after creating the repository:\n1. Log into your production instance. In the navigation header, select\nMore\n>\nAdmin\n.\nThe\nAdmin Settings\ndisplays.\n2. Under\nGovernance\n, select\nSandbox.\n3. Go to\nRepositories > My Repositories.\n4. Locate the repository and select\nCommit.\n5. Enter a description for the new version.\u00a0By default, the new version is promoted. If you don't want the new version to be immediately available for promotion, uncheck the\nAllow this commit to be promoted\nbox.\n6. Select\nSave\n.\nThe process to capture and store the new version is initiated.\nPromoting and Linking the Repository\n1. Log into your development instance. In the navigation header, select\nMore\n>\nAdmin\n.\nThe\nAdmin Settings\ndisplays.\n2. Under\nGovernance\n, select\nSandbox\n.\n3. In the\nShared Repositories\ntab, locate the linked repository. Select\nAssign Owner\n.\nThe\nAssign Owner\nmodal displays.\nNote:\nLinked repositories are indicated with\nnext to the Repository Name.\n4. Enter the name of the owner. They can promote, delete, and share the repository.\n5. Select\nSave\n.\nAfter an owner has been assigned to the repository in the development instance, the\nAssign Owner\nbutton will be replaced with\nPromote.\n6.

Select\nPromote and Link.\n9. Enter a new repository name and review the information in the modal below.\n10. Select\nPromote and Link.\nThis final step does the following:\nPromotes the repository in the development instance. This creates\u00a0the objects in the development.\nCreates a new repository in the development instance with the name entered in Step 5. The new repository includes\u00a0the objects created\u00a0during the promotion and commits this new repository.\nShares this repository with the production instance and allows production to promote this new repository.\nMaps this new repository to the existing production objects. This step is critical because it causes the production objects to be updated by this new repository.\nVerifying Success\n1. In the development instance, confirm that the newly created repository exists in the\nMy Repositories\ntab.\n2. Confirm that the objects were promoted successfully.\u00a0You may need to refresh your browser to load newly created objects.\n3. Ensure that the new repository was committed successfully.\nImportant:\nIf there is an error in the process, Sandbox will undo any completed steps from the promotion and link, and you should not see a new repository.\n4. (Optional) Delete the original linked repository. Ongoing changes should be made in the development instance and promoted to production.\n5. Go back into the production instance and promote the repository that was created in the development instance. This does not create duplicate content as a typical repository would. Instead, it promotes on top of the original content since the content in development is mapped to the content in production.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005059\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

After you create a linked repository, we recommend only promoting from development to production.\nFor more general information about Sandbox, see\nDomo Sandbox.\nKey Terms\nTerm\nDescription\nProduction Instance\nThe destination instance where the dashboards and/or DataFlows currently exist.\nDevelopment Instance\nThe source instance where the dashboards and/or DataFlows are populated and used as a source of Sandbox.\nCreating a Linked Repository\nNote:\nBefore creating a linked repository, ensure that relationships between instances are established. This is necessary when two instances are involved. To learn how to create\u00a0instance relationships, see\nDomo Sandbox.\n1. Log into your production instance. In the navigation header, select\nMore\n>\nAdmin\n.\nThe\nAdmin Settings\ndisplays.\n2. Under\nGovernance\n, select\nSandbox\n.\n3. In the\nMy Repositories\ntab, select\n+ New Repository.\n4. Configure the repository:\nName\u00a0the repository.\nSelect\u00a0the\nCreate as Linked Repository\nbox.\nSelect\u00a0the\nObject Type\nbeing versioned.\nChoose\u00a0the items you want to include in the repository\nNote:\nBy default,\nCreate initial commit\nis selected. When the repository is saved, the first version is committed.\n5. Select\nSave Repository\n.\nThe\nShare Access\nmodal displays. You can share the linked repository with the development instance during this step or later. For more information, see the Instance Sharing heading of\nDomo Sandbox\n.\n6. In the list of\nInstances Without Access\n,\u00a0find your development instance and change the permissions from\nNo Access\nto\nCan Promote.\nNote:\nOnly instances with pre-configured relationships display. For information on inviting instances, see the Instance Relationships heading of\nDomo Sandbox.\n7. Select\nClose.\nThe repository is stored in Sandbox in the\nMy Repositories\ntab, and access is shared with the development instance.\nCommitting the Linked Repository\nThe initial commit occurs if specified while creating the repository.\nIf no committed version exists, complete these steps after creating the repository:\n1. Log into your production instance. In the navigation header, select\nMore\n>\nAdmin\n.\nThe\nAdmin Settings\ndisplays.\n2. Under\nGovernance\n, select\nSandbox.\n3. Go to\nRepositories > My Repositories.\n4. Locate the repository and select\nCommit.\n5. Enter a description for the new version.\u00a0By default, the new version is promoted. If you don't want the new version to be immediately available for promotion, uncheck the\nAllow this commit to be promoted\nbox.\n6. Select\nSave\n.\nThe process to capture and store the new version is initiated.\nPromoting and Linking the Repository\n1. Log into your development instance. In the navigation header, select\nMore\n>\nAdmin\n.\nThe\nAdmin Settings\ndisplays.\n2. Under\nGovernance\n, select\nSandbox\n.\n3. In the\nShared Repositories\ntab, locate the linked repository. Select\nAssign Owner\n.\nThe\nAssign Owner\nmodal displays.\nNote:\nLinked repositories are indicated with\nnext to the Repository Name.\n4. Enter the name of the owner. They can promote, delete, and share the repository.\n5. Select\nSave\n.\nAfter an owner has been assigned to the repository in the development instance, the\nAssign Owner\nbutton will be replaced with\nPromote.\n6. Locate the linked repository and select\nPromote.\nThe repository's details display.\n7. (Conditional) Perform any necessary mappings and apply advanced settings, if applicable.\n8. Select\nPromote and Link.\n9. Enter a new repository name and review the information in the modal below.\n10. Select\nPromote and Link.\nThis final step does the following:\nPromotes the repository in the development instance. This creates\u00a0the objects in the development.\nCreates a new repository in the development instance with the name entered in Step 5. The new repository includes\u00a0the objects created\u00a0during the promotion and commits this new repository.\nShares this repository with the production instance and allows production to promote this new repository.\nMaps this new repository to the existing production objects. This step is critical because it causes the production objects to be updated by this new repository.\nVerifying Success\n1. In the development instance, confirm that the newly created repository exists in the\nMy Repositories\ntab.\n2. Confirm that the objects were promoted successfully.\u00a0You may need to refresh your browser to load newly created objects.\n3. Ensure that the new repository was committed successfully.\nImportant:\nIf there is an error in the process, Sandbox will undo any completed steps from the promotion and link, and you should not see a new repository.\n4. (Optional) Delete the original linked repository. Ongoing changes should be made in the development instance and promoted to production.\n5. Go back into the production instance and promote the repository that was created in the development instance. This does not create duplicate content as a typical repository would. Instead, it promotes on top of the original content since the content in development is mapped to the content in production.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005059\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

You can also discover relationships between locations and important locations.\nThis guide describes how to implement the Flex Map v2 app in the following topics:\nPrerequisites\nConfiguring required DataSets\nConfiguring Domo user groups\nConnecting your data to the app\nPrerequisites\nBefore you can use Flex Map v2, you need to create the following groups in your Domo instance:\n_FlexMap_Admins\n_FlexMap_ViewOnly\nConfiguring Required DataSets\nBefore you can configure the app, you need to create two DataSets to power the four main parts of its functionality:\nPin Layers\nHeatmaps\nMap\u00a0Layers\nUploading custom KML or GEOJSON layer files to display\nThe details for the two DataSets are as follows:\nLocations Data \u2014 This is the main locations DataSet. Rows of locations data are mapped by latitude and longitude.\nHeatmap\u00a0Data \u2014 This is the main Heatmap DataSet. Rows of data by region display as numerical or categorical heat maps.\nPrepare each DataSet as detailed below.\nLocations Data\nThe app requires the following fields for the Locations DataSet.\nImportant:\nThe required fields are case sensitive, so make sure to add these columns to your data with the names as shown.\nColumn Name\nDescription\nLocation Id\nA unique number/letter combination for a location.\nLatitude\nThe latitude of a location.\nLongitude\nThe longitude of a location.\nLocation Name\nThe name of the location.\nThis value should be a 1:1 relation with the Location Id for the location. You can have multiple rows for a single location and the app groups the data for the location together by the ID\u00a0and name.\nAddress\nThe address of a location.\nSearchCache\nA comma separated list of terms you want the app to use to find the location when searching using the main search bar of the app.\nAdditional Columns\nAny additional columns for data and metrics for the locations you want to display with the mapped pins.\nPossible values include: Region, other address data, other metrics\nHeatmap Data\nUse this data to map metrics to regions for the Heatmaps in the app. The most important columns from this data are RegionCode and RegionType.\nThe app uses statistical regions to create the Heatmaps, so you need to map your metric data to the region types that the app needs.\nFor example, if you are in the USA and you have metric data based on zip code, you need to map your zip codes to CBSA codes in order for the map to use your data. You can easily find data to map your data to these codes online.\nThe app supports the following region codes/types: CBSA for the USA, CMA for Canada, SA3 for Australia, and NUTS 2 for Europe. Reach out to your Account Executive (AE) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you need regions beyond what is available.\nThe app requires the following fields for the Heatmap DataSet.\nThe three required fields are case sensitive, so add them to your data with the names as shown:\nColumn Name\nDescription\nRegionCode\nThe code for the area that corresponds to the value in the RegionType column.\nExample: RegionCode: 30030; RegionType: CBSA\nRegionName\n(Optional) The name of the region, if applicable.\nRegionType\nThe value corresponds to the value in the RegionCode.\nPossible values include: CBSA, CMA, NUTS 2, and SA3.\nYour Metric Columns\nAny columns with the metrics that you want to use to build your heat maps. You can add as many as you want, but at least one is required for heat map functionality.\nAdditional Metadata Columns\nOptional\u00a0columns with metadata about the regions you want to map that\u00a0use Domo Page filters to filter through the data.\nConfiguring Domo User Groups\nFlex Map v2 supports three different user levels\u2014Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nTo have admin or view-only privileges within the app, users must be added to a Domo Group. Standard users aren't added to a group and receive the standard app privileges and functionality. The following list describes the differences between the three user levels:\nAdmin users can\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, and configure a default map and a default center.\nStandard users can\u00a0create their own items\u00a0and\u00a0see things that admin users share with them, but can't share items or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can't create anything in the app. They can only view items that admin users share with them.\nTo add admin and view-only users, a Domo admin must navigate to the Domo admin portal and create two Domo Groups:\u00a0_FlexMap_Admins and\u00a0_FlexMap_ViewOnly.\nAdd a user to either group to give them admin or view-only privileges, or do not add the user to either group to give them standard user privileges.\nConnecting Your Data to the App\nAfter you configure the required DataSets and user groups, you can deploy the app and connect your data.\nIf you have access to the app card inside the\nAsset Library\n, deploy the app\u00a0to a dashboard in Domo and follow the numbered steps below.\nIf the app card has been deployed for you with sample data, navigate to the app, then follow the numbered steps below.\nFollow these steps to connect your data to the app:\nHover over the top right corner of the app\u00a0until\nCard options\ndisplays floating over the other map controls.\nSelect\nCard options\n>\nEdit Card\n.

You can have multiple rows for a single location and the app groups the data for the location together by the ID\u00a0and name.\nAddress\nThe address of a location.\nSearchCache\nA comma separated list of terms you want the app to use to find the location when searching using the main search bar of the app.\nAdditional Columns\nAny additional columns for data and metrics for the locations you want to display with the mapped pins.\nPossible values include: Region, other address data, other metrics\nHeatmap Data\nUse this data to map metrics to regions for the Heatmaps in the app. The most important columns from this data are RegionCode and RegionType.\nThe app uses statistical regions to create the Heatmaps, so you need to map your metric data to the region types that the app needs.\nFor example, if you are in the USA and you have metric data based on zip code, you need to map your zip codes to CBSA codes in order for the map to use your data. You can easily find data to map your data to these codes online.\nThe app supports the following region codes/types: CBSA for the USA, CMA for Canada, SA3 for Australia, and NUTS 2 for Europe. Reach out to your Account Executive (AE) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you need regions beyond what is available.\nThe app requires the following fields for the Heatmap DataSet.\nThe three required fields are case sensitive, so add them to your data with the names as shown:\nColumn Name\nDescription\nRegionCode\nThe code for the area that corresponds to the value in the RegionType column.\nExample: RegionCode: 30030; RegionType: CBSA\nRegionName\n(Optional) The name of the region, if applicable.\nRegionType\nThe value corresponds to the value in the RegionCode.\nPossible values include: CBSA, CMA, NUTS 2, and SA3.\nYour Metric Columns\nAny columns with the metrics that you want to use to build your heat maps. You can add as many as you want, but at least one is required for heat map functionality.\nAdditional Metadata Columns\nOptional\u00a0columns with metadata about the regions you want to map that\u00a0use Domo Page filters to filter through the data.\nConfiguring Domo User Groups\nFlex Map v2 supports three different user levels\u2014Admin, Standard, and View-only.\nTo have admin or view-only privileges within the app, users must be added to a Domo Group. Standard users aren't added to a group and receive the standard app privileges and functionality. The following list describes the differences between the three user levels:\nAdmin users can\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, and configure a default map and a default center.\nStandard users can\u00a0create their own items\u00a0and\u00a0see things that admin users share with them, but can't share items or set defaults.\nView-only users\u00a0can't create anything in the app. They can only view items that admin users share with them.\nTo add admin and view-only users, a Domo admin must navigate to the Domo admin portal and create two Domo Groups:\u00a0_FlexMap_Admins and\u00a0_FlexMap_ViewOnly.\nAdd a user to either group to give them admin or view-only privileges, or do not add the user to either group to give them standard user privileges.\nConnecting Your Data to the App\nAfter you configure the required DataSets and user groups, you can deploy the app and connect your data.\nIf you have access to the app card inside the\nAsset Library\n, deploy the app\u00a0to a dashboard in Domo and follow the numbered steps below.\nIf the app card has been deployed for you with sample data, navigate to the app, then follow the numbered steps below.\nFollow these steps to connect your data to the app:\nHover over the top right corner of the app\u00a0until\nCard options\ndisplays floating over the other map controls.\nSelect\nCard options\n>\nEdit Card\n. The card editor opens.\n(Optional) Check the box for\nFullpage\nif you want to see the full page of the app as you edit.\nAt the bottom of\u00a0the card editor screen, locate\u00a0the data\nMapping\narea.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like.

This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account.

To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account.

To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID.

The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\nThis change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\nAdditional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\nIntro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\nOnce your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n).\nYou connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nNote:\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\nPrimary Use Cases\nThis connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\nPrimary Metrics\nCashflow\nLedgers\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts payable\nJournals\nProfits and loss\nPrimary Company Roles\nCFO\nAccountant\nSales\nInventory\nAverage Implementation Time\nConnector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\nEase of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n7\nBest Practices\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nKeep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nThe password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\nYour Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nCompany Info\n.\nCompany ID\nis found in the\nID\nfield.\n(Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\nCompany\nand click\nLocations\n. Select a\nLocation ID\nfrom the report.\n(Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAdditionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\nauthorized sender ID\nin their company configurations Security tab.\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\nConnecting to your Intacct Account\nThis section enumerates the options in the\nCredentials\nand\nDetails\npanes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\nScheduling\nand\nName & Describe Your DataSet\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n.\nCredentials Pane\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\nField\nDescription\nUser ID\nEnter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nPassword\nEnter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\nCompany ID\nEnter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\nLocation ID (Optional)\nEnter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\nMax Concurrent Connections (Optional)\nEnter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\nAfter you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\nAccounts\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n.\nDetails Pane\nThis pane contains a primary\nReports\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\nMenu\nDescription\nReport\nSelect the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\nPrerequisites\nto get the right information.\nFAQs\nWhat endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\nWhat's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\nSummary (only shown to internal users)\nPreview Article\nClick here to preview\nURL Name\n000005099\nSummary\nBriefly describe the article.
