<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Flex Map v2 is a premium app available in the Appstore. Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.</p>
<p>Before you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations. Learn about these in the</p>
<p>Flex Map v2 Implementation Guide</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>*Important:** Flex Map v2 is not the same as Flex Map v1. Learn about how to use that app in the</p>
<p>Flex Map v1 User Guide</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This guide provides information for using Flex Map v2 in the following topics: * App navigation * Pin Layers * Map Layers * Favorites * Saved Maps * Heatmaps * Map Settings * Data Settings * User permissions and features * Interacting with the map * Demo notes</p>
</section>
<section id="app-navigation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="app-navigation">App Navigation</h2>
<p>Map controls display on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>The table below describes each of the map controls.</p>

<p>*Item** to create a new Pin Layer.</p>
<p>The <strong>New Pin Layers</strong> <strong>Search</strong> interface displays. 2. Select the list and choose a column from your data to begin filtering down the connected locations data to a subset of the data you want to display on the map. If your data is not connected, complete the necessary configuration by following the steps in the</p>
<p>Flex Map v2 Implementation Guide</p>
<p>. 3. Below the selected column, select whether to include locations that are <strong>In</strong> or <strong>Not In</strong> the values you select from the column. 4. (Optional) To apply more filtering criteria, select <strong>Item</strong> again to add another Pin Layer to the current layers. * First, select whether the Pin Layer has an <strong>And</strong> or an <strong>Or</strong> filter.</p>
<p>An <em>And</em> filter combines current Pin Layers with previous Pin Layers so that only locations that meet all <em>And</em> criteria display.</p>
<pre><code> Using an
 *Or*
 filter adds all locations that match&nbsp;that filter along with any other filters that are set.
* Next, choose the category of additional Layer:
 **Parent Id**
 ,
 **Latitude**
 ,
 **Longitude**
 ,
 **Location Name**
 , or
 **City**
 .</code></pre>
<p>Two more options, <strong>Channel Type</strong> and <strong>Channel Group</strong> , only display if more than one Pin Layer is pinned.</p>
<p>You can</p>
<p>*Delete<strong> any Pin Layer to remove that filter. 5. Select </strong>List<strong> to view the results based on the search criteria. 6. (Optional) Select the star icon next to any result to add it to the </strong>Favorites<strong> section of the app. 7. After adding all of your filters, note the three buttons added to the </strong>Pin Layers<strong> menu: </strong>Select Icon<strong> , </strong>Select Color<strong> , and </strong>Save** .</p>
<section id="section-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-1"></h4>
<p>Adding Icons and Colors</p>
<p>You can choose to display specific locations or landmarks on the map with the icon selection palette. You can only use one icon per Pin Layer. If you want to add another icon, create a new Pin Layer.</p>
<p>. Choose <strong>Select Icon</strong> in the <strong>Pin Layers</strong> menu.</p>
<p>The icon palette opens. 2. Select an icon to add to the Pin Layer. 3. (Optional) Go to the <strong>Size</strong> tab of the palette to adjust the size of the icon.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make an icon static or dynamic. If the icon is dynamic, the size changes with the zoom level of the map.</p>
<p>The icon displays on the map. If it doesn’t display, adjust the zoom level. 4. In the <strong>Pin Layers</strong> menu, choose <strong>Select Color</strong> to choose the display color for your search. 5. Select <strong>Save</strong> in the <strong>Pin Layers</strong> menu to save your search.</p>
<p>The <strong>Save Pin Layers Search</strong> modal displays. 6. Enter a <strong>Name</strong> and choose a <strong>Folder</strong> or <strong>Group</strong> to save the search in or create one. 7. Select <strong>Save</strong> .</p>

<section id="map-layers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="map-layers">Map Layers</h2>
<p>Map Layers in the Flex Map v2 app are data driven from values stored in KML or GeoJSON, so interaction with them is more limited than other items in the app. The purpose of Map Layers is to display constantly updated lines or shapes on the map with their associated metrics, which are read directly from the uploaded layer file. For example, you may want to display shipping routes and their attributes from an outside system.</p>
<p>To begin, the data for layers must be correctly prepared. Learn how to do that in the</p>
<p>Flex Map v2 Implementation Guide</p>
<p>.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-3" class="level2">

<p>*Circle** again to delete it.</p>
<p>The second of the three icons is</p>
<p>*Polygon** and allows you to create a shape with numerous sides. To use the tool, select</p>
<p>*Polygon<strong> and choose a point on the map where you want the shape to begin. Keep adding points to the map until you achieve the shape you want. To finish the shape, select the last orange dot that you placed. You can move the entire shape by clicking inside it and dragging. To adjust the shape, click and drag the orange dots. To change the color, use the </strong>Select Color** icon. To delete the shape, select</p>
<p>*Polygon** again.</p>
<p>The last icon is</p>
<p>*Polyline** , which allows you to determine the total distance traveled along a path. You can create this path by clicking on the map, which leaves a trail of orange dots for every marker you place. When you are done, select the last orange marker you&nbsp;placed; the total distance of the polyline displays. To start over, select</p>
<p>*Polyline** again.</p>

<section id="user-permissions-and-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-permissions-and-features">User Permissions and Features</h2>
<p>The app supports three user levels: Admin, Standard, and View-only.</p>
<p>Admin users can create, edit, and delete items in the app,&nbsp;share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, create custom Map Layers,&nbsp;and configure a default map and a default center. See</p>
<p>Map Settings</p>
<p>,&nbsp;above. * Standard users can&nbsp;create, edit, and delete&nbsp;their own items, and view items that admins share with them. They&nbsp;can’t share items, create Map Layers, or set defaults. * View-only users&nbsp;can&nbsp;view items that admins share with them. They can’t&nbsp;create, edit, or delete items. They also cannot share items or set defaults.</p>
<p>To learn more, see the</p>
<p>Flex Map v2 Implementation Guide</p>
<p>.</p>
</section>
<section id="interacting-with-the-map" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interacting-with-the-map">Interacting with the Map</h2>
<p>After you create searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps, you can interact with these items on the map.</p>
<p>Searches display as colored dots on the map called Pins. If a Pin represents an individual location, it is a small dot without a number in the middle. If it represents a cluster of locations, the dot is larger and has a number in the middle representing the number of grouped locations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom into a clustered Pin to see the distinct locations.</li>
<li>Selecting a clustered Pin zooms into that location by one level.</li>
<li>Selecting an individual Pin opens a details panel that shows additional information for that location. If the additional information includes URLs, the URLs are colored orange and are clickable. If the additional information includes a link to an image, the image displays in the details panel.</li>
<li>Hovering over an individual Pin displays a tooltip for that location which card owners and admins&nbsp;can configure in the</li>
</ul>
<p>*Data Settings**</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Map Layers display on the map as a filled-in border around the geographical area.</p>
<p>Hovering over the territory displays the name of the location you are hovering over. Heatmaps display as multi-colored areas filled in with colors representing the value of the Heatmap metric. * Hovering over the Heatmap displays a tooltip with the metric that the color of the area represents. * Selecting a Heatmap area brings up a tooltip showing all related Heatmap metrics for that area. * A legend of what each of the Heatmap’s colors represents displays in the lower-left corner of the map.</p>
<p>Enter a term in the search bar at the top of the screen to view all the Pins that match your search entry.</p>
<p>You can use this to quickly find a single location, a group of locations, or to create a favorite by selecting the star next to the location in the search results.</p>
<p>*Note:<strong> Admins see options to </strong>Set as Default<strong> and </strong>Set as Center** at the bottom of the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting <strong>Set as Default</strong> saves any displayed searches, Map Layers, and Heatmaps as the map default. This means that any user who loads the app views these default items when the app loads, as long as the items have been shared with them.</li>
<li>Selecting <strong>Set as Center</strong> sets the current view of the map as the default center. This means, for example, that an admin can set the contiguous United States as the default view, zoom in, and then&nbsp;save the revised view&nbsp;so that other users view&nbsp;it&nbsp;when they open the app.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="demo-notes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demo-notes">Demo Notes</h2>
<p>One way to demo the app is to upload a DataSet to power pin locations based on lat/long and Heatmap metrics.</p>
<p>Then show how to build territories and save searches and Heatmaps.</p>
